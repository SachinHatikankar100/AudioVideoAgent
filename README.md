This is Audio Video Agent built using Agno and python libraries

Agno does provide the ability to summarize the videos using appropriate models I hae used gemini-2.0-flash-lite

I could not find the ability with Agno agents to get a summary of the video and audio both together

I tried to get the audio using native python libraries and have supplied it to the model explicitly so that it atleast provides the audio from the same artist and gives a better summary of the video


Usage:

You can supply any reels to this code base which is in .mp4 format. Rest the agents can handle the task of summarizing the video also giving you the additional songs from the same artists
