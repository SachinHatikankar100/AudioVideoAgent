This is Audio Video Agent built using Agno and python libraries

Agno does provide the ability to summarize the videos using appropriate models I hae used gemini-2.0-flash-lite
I could not find the ability with Agno agents to get a summary of the video and audio both together

I tried to get the audio using native python libraries and have supplied it to the model explicitly so that it atleast provides the audio from the same artist and gives a better summary of the video
